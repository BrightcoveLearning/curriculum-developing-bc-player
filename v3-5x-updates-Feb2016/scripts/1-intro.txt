Hi. I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist with Brightcove. Welcome to the Developing with Brightcove Player on-demand training course.

To create this course, I've taken our standard Developing with Brightcove Player training, and divided it up into a series of videos that you can consume at your own pace and on your own schedule.

During the course, we'll write code to address a series of use cases to get familiar with the process using JavaScript, HTML and CSS to modify the behavior of Brightcove Player.

Let's take a quick look at the agenda.

(switch to slides)
First, notice the structure of the course alternates between content presentation, and then a corresponding code task. That may be bit misleading, as normally we will just jump right into the code, then use a few slides for a quick review.

The first task we'll tackle is setting up the environment to develop with Brightcove Player, and then programmatically play a video.

Secondly, we'll dynamically load a video into the player and learn how to manipulate metadata about the video.

Next, we'll use Brightcove Player in an iframe.

Finally, two very helpful features of Brightcove Player will be used, those being plugins and playlists.

One quick note on prerequisites. If you have a basic knowledge of HTMl and JavaScript you'll find the content of this course appropriate.

(back to speaking)
Hopefully, you'll find this training extremely useful. We welcome any comments or suggestions you have on this training, or any of our documentation. Please feel free to email us at training@brightcove.com.

We've got a lot of coding tasks to complete, so let's get started.
