Hi. I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist with Brightcove. Welcome to the developing with Brightcove Player on-demand training course.       </p>
      <p>
I've taken our standard developing with Brightcove Player training and broken it into a series of videos, which you can consume at your own pace. During the course, we'll write code to address a series of use cases to begin learning about using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to modify the look and behavior of Brightcove Player.       </p>
      <p>
Let's take a quick look at the agenda.       </p>
      <p>
First, notice the structure of the course alternates between content presentation and then a corresponding code task. This may be a bit misleading, as normally we'll just jump right into the code then use a few slides for a quick review.       </p>
      <p>
The first task we'll tackle is setting up the environment to develop with Brightcove Player and then programmatically play a video. Secondly, we'll dynamically load a video into the player and learn how to manipulate metadata about the video. Next, we'll use Brightcove Player in an iframe implementation. Finally, two very helpful features a Brightcove Player will be used, those being plugins and playlists.       </p>
      <p>
One quick note on prerequisites. If you have a basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, you'll find the content of this course appropriate.       </p>
      <p>
Hopefully you'll find this training extremely useful. If you have any questions or comments about this training or any of our documentation, please feel free to email us at training@brightcove.com.       </p>
      <p>
We've got a lot of coding to do, so let's get started.       </p>
