In the last video, we saw a very powerful feature of Brightcove Player. And that was plugins. In this video, another very powerful feature we're going to use. And that is playlists.       </p>
      <p>
Most of what we do with playlists can actually be done in Studio. And then all we need to do to customize it a little bit is style the player and the playlist together. Let's go ahead and get started.       </p>
      <p>
I go into Studio, and then into Players. And in Players, going to select a player. And then in the Settings section, I'm going to Edit. And then what I want to do is Enable Playlists.       </p>
      <p>
And you can say, do you want to auto-advance to the next one? That's fine. You can also manually start it. Auto-start it if you want. In this case, I'm going to say no.       </p>
      <p>
And then all we have to do is say Save. Yes. I want to publish now. Let's go ahead and Publish. All right. That's been published.       </p>
      <p>
Now I'm going to go to the Media module. And I need to select a playlist. And then I'm going to publish it.       </p>
      <p>
When you're in a playlist, you want to be sure you publish it with a player that has playlists enabled. So I'm going to click Publish. Select the correct one, which was our On-demand Training.       </p>
      <p>
And then you can see there's a video. There's the playlist there. I'm going to scroll down.       </p>
      <p>
And again, we're going to experiment and look at the code. So we're going to get the advanced implementation. Going to copy that.       </p>
      <p>
Now let's go back and use this in our editor. So here's task 7. And you can see there's nothing that we are using from before. So I'm going to go in, paste in what I have.       </p>
      <p>
And most of this will look familiar to you, except there's one thing that gets added on here. Notice we have the script. And then there's this ol, an HTML ordered list. And that ordered list can go anywhere you want. And the ordered list, you can probably see by the class, is, in fact, the actual playlist.       </p>
      <p>
OK. We're going to Save this. And we're going to go out and see how it looks by default. We're working on task 7.       </p>
      <p>
Well, you can see the video is small and the playlist is here underneath it and real wide. Let's clean this up a little bit. And what I like to do is have a bigger video and then the playlist just to the right of it. So let's do that.       </p>
      <p>
Let's go back to our code and see what we can do.       </p>
      <p>
Once we're back in our editor, what we want to do is style both the player and the playlist. You don't want to see me type all those styles.       </p>
      <p>
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the task 7 steps. And I'm going to copy the style block here. Put it into the head. Save it. And let's see how this looks.       </p>
      <p>
Here's the old one. Going to Refresh. There. That looks better, right? So we can start this. I can click on another one, it takes off.       </p>
      <p>
By the way, if the video is playing in the player, when you click on a new video it will be playing. If the video is not playing and you click on another one, then it won't be playing. So it reads what's happening in the player.       </p>
      <p>
Well, let's go look a little bit at those styles. See what happens.       </p>
      <p>
So in the styles, again, nothing to do with the Brightcove Player API, but important to be able to use what we're given. We're going to float both the player and the playlist. Again, we're using class selectors. So they're side by side.       </p>
      <p>
The margin of 15, what that does is that actually separates the player from the playlist, gives us that little gap right here. That's the gap we see, the 15.       </p>
      <p>
And then the width and height. So you can set the width and height whatever is appropriate for your player. In this case, 640 by 365.       </p>
      <p>
By the way, there are lots of docs on how to make the player responsive. We're not doing that in this video.       </p>
      <p>
The playlist styles a float again, that makes them side by side. You can set the width to whatever you want.       </p>
      <p>
And the height may seem a little odd to you. Like, why don't I make the height the same as the player? One is 365 and one is 348. But when I look at them, they seem to be the same height.       </p>
      <p>
Well, the reason is there are some styles that we need to compensate for. So I'm going to go in and I'm going to inspect this. Pull this up a little bit. And notice there's padding of 17 pixels.       </p>
      <p>
And what that does is that is the padding around the thumbnails in the description. If you didn't have that padding in, those would be right on the edge. And so what happens then, that makes that grow by 17 pixels.       </p>
      <p>
And so what we have to do when we're setting the height is we need to compensate for that. So I'm going to set the height of the playlist 17 pixels less than the height of the player. And that will make that the correct size.       </p>
      <p>
Want to mention, we have docs on how to make the playlist responsive, how to use a CAD playlist.       </p>
      <p>
Let's look at a few slides now to reinforce what we've just learned. As we know, we create playlists in Studio's Media module. And we saw that the default appearance of the player, depending on how its sized in the playlist, don't seem to be the same.       </p>
      <p>
You can go and move the playlist around a little bit. Let's look at that.       </p>
      <p>
So here we have the vertical on the side, kind of what we're used to. We can have it horizontal underneath. There is the playlist.       </p>
      <p>
And also we can do stacked. And what's stacked is is underneath. But you can see, you can have the whole description there.       </p>
      <p>
So yeah. You can change the style to do different kinds of layouts.       </p>
      <p>
As we saw, to be able to get the information to tell the player we want to use a playlist, we can do that in the Players module, the Settings section. Of course, then we have to Save and Publish.       </p>
      <p>
We're going to go into the Media module. Grab a playlist and say we want to publish it with the playlist enabled player. And then you use your desired code implementation.       </p>
      <p>
In this case, I wanted to show the advanced one. It's a little bit trickier in this case. We have to use styles. The iframe implementation or standard code, it actually works side by side. All you have to do is really size the iframe.       </p>
      <p>
Here you can see this is what we've done. We use the ordered list. And then we style both the video player and the playlist.       </p>
      <p>
And here's the iframe implementation. The playlist is inside the Iframe. And all you need to do is size the iframe.       </p>
      <p>
That completes our task 7, which is also our last task of this series, developing with Brightcove Player. You've seen, if you want to go out, you can experiment with a CodePen. Change different styles to see how they look together.       </p>
      <p>
We've now put together the playlist. And that wraps up the course.       </p>
      <p>
Thank you very much for going through developing with Brightcove Player with me. I hope it was helpful. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to email me. That's mboles@brightcove.com.       </p>
      <p>
Thank you for being Brightcove customers. And thank you for your time.       </p>
