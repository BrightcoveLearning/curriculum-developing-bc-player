Welcome to the next video in our developing with Brightcove Player series for on-demand training. In the last video, we used the iframe implementation of the player. So now we've see both the iframe implementation and the inpage embed implementation. And in this video, we're going to be using plugins.       </p>
      <p>
We have two use cases we're going to be accomplishing in this video. The first one is to play IMA3 ads. And to do that, we're going to use an IMA3 plugin, not surprisingly.       </p>
      <p>
And by the way, the ads are configured so there's a pre-roll, a mid-roll and a post-roll.       </p>
      <p>
And the second use case we're going to be looking at is we're going to display an overlay that uses data from the MediaInfo object. And so we're going to use an overlay plugin to display an overlay.       </p>
      <p>
All right. Let's get started here. And this is going to be a little bit different than the previous videos because we're not going to jump right into code. We actually have some theory we need to understand first.       </p>
      <p>
That first piece of information we want to make sure we understand is just what is a plugin? And basically, a plugin modifies the behavior somehow or the appearance of the player.       </p>
      <p>
And to do that, we're going to use our skills. We have, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. And really, anything you can think of you might want to do with the player, if you can do it in JavaScript, HTML, or CSS, you can implement that as a plugin.       </p>
      <p>
There are a number of plugins that are supplied and maintained by Brightcove. You see a list of them here in this slide. I also want to go out and show you where information about these plugins are in the documentation.       </p>
      <p>
Here's the default page for the documentation. And I'm going to scroll down. And here we see information about the plugins. And also notice there is a section on plugin development.       </p>
      <p>
As you can see, some of the plugins are loaded by default. So we'll always have the debugger there, the errors, and the HLS plugins.       </p>
      <p>
All right. So we know these plugins exist. And we know we can use ones that are prebuilt or we can build our own. And so once we build them, how do we actually implement them? And there's three ways to do that.       </p>
      <p>
The first way is simply going into Studio. And some of the plugins are totally UI based in Studio. And one we're going to do this ways we're going to do the IMA3 plugin for advertising via Studio.       </p>
      <p>
The next way is you can write code. And so you can put in a script that points to the JavaScript for the overlay. You can put a link that points to the CSS for the overlay. And you can write some code around the plugin itself.       </p>
      <p>
A couple things to understand here. When you use the Studio implementation, the overlay will be in use for all instances of that player. When you use a custom code on the page, it is only going to be applied for that player on that page.       </p>
      <p>
If you want to have a player and you're going to show a whole bunch of videos in it, and you want the plugin to be in use all the time, you most likely would want to implement in Studio. But if you have a one-off, then you may want to do it in the page.       </p>
      <p>
Another reason to implement, and you see this down at the bottom of the slide, we have some flexibility because we can use information that we have available on the page. Like, for instance, data from the MediaInfo object. And that's what we're going to do when we do our demonstration for the overlay plugin.       </p>
      <p>
The last way, and most people probably would want to do it this way. But if you're familiar with the player management, you can also use a curl statement to go in and add plugins to your player that way.       </p>
      <p>
OK. So our first use case was to play some IMA3 ads. And that's what we're going to do in the first task. And we can actually take care of all of that inside of Studio.       </p>
      <p>
So I've gone in and I've created a player. And I'm going to scroll down. And we see down here on the bottom left. I'm going to edit here. And I'm going to enable IMA ads.       </p>
      <p>
Server URL. This would be something you'd either get from your ad server provider or, in this case, I've actually built a VAST document by hand. So I'm going to paste that in.       </p>
      <p>
You can see, there's a VMAP document I've just built by hand. That's all good.       </p>
      <p>
And I'm going to accept all the defaults here. So I'm going to click Save. And I'm then going to Publish it. And I'm going to Publish it.       </p>
      <p>
Now, just as we've done earlier, you could then go to media, pick a video. And then when the video plays, you'll see the ads.       </p>
      <p>
We know how to do that. And here in Studio, I can actually go ahead and just use the Sample Cloud video here to see the ads play.       </p>
      <p>
I'm going to click the Play button. And here's the ad. They do have audio--       </p>
      <p>
Downloading the "Hero's guide to video Marketing"--       </p>
      <p>
But we don't need to listen to all that. Another ad is going to pop up here in just a moment. The mid-roll.       </p>
      <p>
And then there's the new way. Supercharge your--       </p>
      <p>
We'll skip this ad. And then we're going to jump to the end of the video so we can see the post-roll.       </p>
      <p>
Learn how to align your brand into your video marketing efforts by downloading the "Hero's Guide to Video Marketing."       </p>
      <p>
That's how easy it is to use the IMA3 plugin. And I went, accepted all the defaults. Here's the URL to where the ads are defined.       </p>
      <p>
And as you can see, I had a pre-roll, and mid-roll, and a post-roll defined for that. And that is using the IMA3 plugin. And again, this was all Studio-based exercise.       </p>
      <p>
We've now completed task 5, where we played IMA3 3 ads and did the IMA3 plugin and set up in Studio.       </p>
      <p>
Be sure you watch part 2 of the plugin session, where we are going to use the overlay plugin. Implement it using code. And in that code, use information from the MediaInfo object.       </p>
