I want to take just a minute to be sure you have an environment ready to begin doing your development with Brightcove Player. Here is a list of the basics you will need.       </p>
      <p>
First is a Video Cloud account. And by the way, a trial account will work.       </p>
      <p>
You will also need some kind of editor in which to write code. You will see later I use Atom from GitHub, but any editor will do.       </p>
      <p>
If you're going to test using the iframe implementation of the player, which we'll discuss later, you will need a local web server. XAMPP and WAMP are free options. I will be using WAMP.       </p>
      <p>
If you want to use the student files we utilized during this course, you can get them out on GitHub. Here you see the URL to the GitHub repo, as well as a Bitly shortened version. Be sure to get the latest version, as I do revise the materials occasionally.       </p>
      <p>
Another key element in getting ready to do development is knowing the location of the documentation. There are two basic kinds of documentation for Brightcove Player, the standard docs and the API docs.       </p>
      <p>
This is the Home page for Brightcove Player documentation. Here we have various kinds of content from conceptual overviews, to feature, how-tos, and samples.       </p>
      <p>
The other kind of documentation are the API docs. These docs are built dynamically from the actual player source code and updated regularly. These docs show the properties, methods, and events for the classes that make up the player.       </p>
      <p>
For instance, here in the actual Player class API, you see what you would most likely expect. Like a method for play and an event for when the video has ended.       </p>
